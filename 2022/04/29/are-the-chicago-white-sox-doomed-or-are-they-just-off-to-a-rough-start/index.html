<p>The Chicago White Sox have been a hot topic for the past few years. After going through a rigorous rebuild, many people are expecting them to win a World Series title in the next couple years. The problem is, the White Sox are currently a “win now” team. They have all the talent they need, but they are struggling to come together as one.</p>
<p>Comparing the 2021 and 2022 seasons is a heartbreaking sight. The White Sox went from having some of the best statistics of 2021 to being at the bottom of the charts in 2022. So, what went wrong?

In 2021, the White Sox had a great on base percentage. They were efficient on getting runners on base and being able to drive them home. But looking at the 2022 season so far, OPS+ seems to be an area this team is struggling. When players aren’t making it on base, no runs are being scored.</p>
<p>We see that this 2022 team is struggling behind the plate, but what does our data look like for the pitchers?

So far, pitching has not been their biggest issue, but if you are a fan and have witnessed some of the pitching recently you may disagree. The reason why pitching isn’t the biggest problem currently is because the White Sox are just floating in the middle of the pack. Also, since the season has just begun, it is hard to say how our pitching will end up.</p>
