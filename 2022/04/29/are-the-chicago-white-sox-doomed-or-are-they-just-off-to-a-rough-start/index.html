<p>The Chicago White Sox have been a hot topic for the past few years. After going through a rigorous rebuild, many people are expecting them to win a World Series title in the next couple years. The problem is, the White Sox are currently a “win now” team. They have all the talent they need, but they are struggling to come together as one.</p>
<p>Comparing the 2021 and 2022 seasons is a heartbreaking sight. The White Sox went from having some of the best statistics of 2021 to being at the bottom of the charts in 2022. So, what went wrong?

<p>In 2021, the White Sox had a great on base percentage. They were efficient on getting runners on base and being able to drive them home. But looking at the 2022 season so far, OPS+ seems to be an area this team is struggling. Keep in mind, the White Sox are currently missing two of their heavy hitters due to injury, so there is hope that the return of Moncada and Jimenez will improve this statistic.</p>
<p>We see that this 2022 team is struggling behind the plate, but what does our data look like for the pitchers?

So far, pitching has not been their biggest issue in 2022. They are floating right around the average mark, keeping their data pretty consistent with the other teams. In comparison to the 2021 pitching data, the White Sox have taken a turn for the worst. On the bright side, the season has just begun, and there is plenty of time to make up for the early season mistakes.</p>
<p>And the White Sox wouldn’t be the White Sox without injuries. At the time of this article, there are currently seven injured pitchers, with only one of those pitchers being on the long term (60 day) injured list.</p>
